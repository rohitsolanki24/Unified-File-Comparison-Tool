#Unified File Comparison Tool
The Unified File Comparison Tool is a user-friendly desktop application for Windows that allows you to easily compare different types of files and visualize their differences. Built with Python and Tkinter, this tool is perfect for developers, data analysts, and anyone who needs to track changes between file versions.

#Key Features
Multi-Format Support: Compare plain text files (.txt) as well as structured data files like .csv, .json, and .xlsx (Excel).

Intuitive Difference Highlighting: For structured files, the tool provides a clear, cell-by-cell breakdown of every mismatch, including the cell location and the differing values.

Drag-and-Drop Interface: Quickly select files by dragging and dropping them directly into the application window.

Export Results: Save the comparison output to a .txt file for your records.

Standalone Application: Packaged as a single .exe file that runs on Windows without needing Python to be installed.
